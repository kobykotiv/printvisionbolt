# 2024-01-09 15:30 - Project Structure Standardization

## Changes Required

1. Consolidate project structure to:
```
printvisionbolt/
├── apps/
│   ├── dashboard/        # Admin dashboard (Next.js)
│   ├── blog/            # Blog application (Next.js)
│   └── storefront/      # Customer-facing store
├── packages/
│   ├── shared-ui/       # Shared UI components
│   ├── utils/           # Shared utilities
│   └── types/          # TypeScript types
├── docs/               # Documentation
└── infrastructure/     # Deployment configs
```

2. Standardize integration specifications:
- Payment: Stripe (for both user payments and vendor payouts)
- Shipping: Handled by print API integration
- Analytics: To be implemented with custom dashboards
- Support: Integrated help desk system

3. Development Standards:
- Package Manager: pnpm
- Build Tool: Turborepo + Turbopack
- Runtime: Bun
- Testing: Vitest
- Linting: ESLint + Prettier
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## Implementation Notes

1. Move contents from vendor/* to apps/*
2. Consolidate all shared code into packages/*
3. Standardize all package.json files to use workspace:* protocol
4. Update all import paths to reflect new structure

## Migration Steps

1. Create new directory structure:
```bash
mkdir -p apps/{dashboard,blog,storefront}
mkdir -p packages/{shared-ui,utils,types}
```

2. Update root package.json workspaces:
```json
{
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*",
    "packages/*"
  ]
}
```

3. Move existing applications:
```bash
mv vendor/dashboard/* apps/dashboard/
mv vendor/blog/* apps/blog/
mv vendor/storefront/* apps/storefront/
```

4. Update all internal dependencies to use workspace protocol:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@printvisionbolt/shared-ui": "workspace:*",
    "@printvisionbolt/utils": "workspace:*",
    "@printvisionbolt/types": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

5. Cleanup old directories:
```bash
rm -rf vendor
```

## Dependencies Matrix

| Package          | Type     | Version | Location          |
|-----------------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Next.js         | Core     | 13.x    | apps/*           |
| TypeScript      | Core     | 5.x     | Root + All       |
| tRPC            | API      | 10.x    | apps/dashboard   |
| Supabase Client | Database | 2.x     | apps/*           |
| Glass UI        | UI       | 1.x     | packages/shared-ui|
| Turborepo       | Build    | Latest  | Root             |
| pnpm            | PM       | 9.x     | Root             |
| Bun             | Runtime  | 1.x     | Root             |

## Performance Requirements

Maintain these targets across all applications:
- First Load: < 2s
- API Response: < 100ms
- Lighthouse Score: > 95
- Runtime Performance: 60fps
