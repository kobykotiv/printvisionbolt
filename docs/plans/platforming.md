Develop a comprehensive art marketplace platform using Next.js. The platform should facilitate the buying and selling of art pieces, with the US Dollar (USD) as the primary currency for all transactions. Implement a robust system where artists can list their artwork, including detailed descriptions, pricing, and high-quality images. Buyers should be able to browse, search, and purchase art with secure payment processing. The marketplace must integrate with an API broker to connect with suppliers who provide the blueprints or manufacturing of the art pieces.

The user must make templates out of blueprints

This integration should automate the fulfillment process, ensuring that orders are seamlessly routed to the appropriate suppliers for production and shipping. The platform should also include features for user accounts, order tracking, and communication between buyers and sellers. Ensure the design is user-friendly, responsive, and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
