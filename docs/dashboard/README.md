# PrintVision Dashboard Documentation

## Overview

The PrintVision dashboard is a tier-based administration interface that provides print-on-demand vendors with capabilities matched to their subscription level. This documentation covers the architectural decisions, implementation patterns, and development guidelines.

## Core Documentation

1. [Feature Tier Architecture](./feature-tier-architecture.md)
   - Core architecture components
   - Implementation guidelines
   - Security measures
   - Performance considerations

2. [Tier-Based Routing](./tier-based-routing.md)
   - Route structure
   - Interface components by tier
   - Component access control
   - Layout strategies

3. [Print Provider Integration](./print-provider-integration.md)
   - Provider integration patterns
   - Tier-specific features
   - Implementation guidelines
   - Security considerations

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Core Technologies
- Next.js 13+ with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Supabase (self-hosted) for database
- tRPC for type-safe APIs
- Bun for enhanced performance

### 2. Key Components
```typescript
interface DashboardStructure {
  auth: {
    protection: 'route-based';
    validation: 'server-side';
    session: 'supabase';
  };
  ui: {
    framework: 'glassomorphic';
    styling: 'tailwind';
    components: 'tier-aware';
  };
  api: {
    structure: 'tRPC';
    protection: 'tier-based';
    caching: 'edge-optimized';
  };
}
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Tier-specific code splitting
- Edge caching for API responses
- Optimized glass effects rendering
- Resource usage monitoring

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Component Development
- Use the shared UI library
- Implement tier-specific variants
- Follow glass effect guidelines
- Ensure responsive design

### 2. Feature Implementation
```typescript
interface FeatureImplementation {
  checks: {
    tierValidation: boolean;
    limitChecking: boolean;
    upgradeFlow: boolean;
  };
  protection: {
    routeLevel: boolean;
    componentLevel: boolean;
    apiLevel: boolean;
  };
  monitoring: {
    usage: boolean;
    performance: boolean;
    errors: boolean;
  };
}
```

### 3. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for features
- E2E tests for user flows
- Performance testing
- Security validation

## Deployment Strategy

### 1. Environment Setup
```typescript
interface DeploymentConfig {
  environments: {
    development: Configuration;
    staging: Configuration;
    production: Configuration;
  };
  monitoring: {
    performance: boolean;
    errors: boolean;
    usage: boolean;
  };
  scaling: {
    auto: boolean;
    rules: ScalingRules;
  };
}
```

### 2. Release Process
- Feature branch workflow
- Automated testing
- Staged rollouts
- Performance monitoring
- Rollback capability

## Security Considerations

1. Authentication
   - Route protection
   - API access control
   - Session management
   - Rate limiting

2. Data Protection
   - Tier-based access control
   - Resource isolation
   - Audit logging
   - Encryption

## Next Steps

1. Immediate Priorities
   - Implement tier-based routing
   - Enhance glass UI components
   - Add print provider integration
   - Update documentation

2. Future Improvements
   - Advanced analytics
   - AI-powered features
   - Enhanced automation
   - Custom integrations
