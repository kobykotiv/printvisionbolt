## 1. Shop Selector
**UI Elements:**
- A list or card view of existing shops.
- A "Create New Shop" button (enabled only if the user’s plan allows additional shops).
- A search/filter bar to find shops by name or category.

## 2. Templates
**UI Elements:**
- A grid or list view displaying each template with a preview image, title, and usage stats.
- A "Create New Template" button that is disabled or shows an upgrade prompt if the user exceeds their template limit.
- Search and filtering functionality to quickly find specific templates.
- We need a way to add or subtract blueprints from existing tempaltes.
- add user warnings when deleting items.

**UX Considerations:**
- **Free users** can create up to **3 templates**; if they try to create more, display a clear message prompting an upgrade.
- For higher tiers, show the current count and the maximum allowed (e.g., “8/10 Templates” for Creator).

---

## 3. Blueprints
**UI Elements:**
- A Blueprint Selector modal with:
  - A search bar for keywords.
  - A dropdown to filter by supplier (with an API status indicator).
  - A grid/list view displaying blueprint cards (title, description, supplier, thumbnail).
  - “Add/Remove” buttons to select blueprints for the template.

**UX Considerations:**
- Display the current count of selected blueprints relative to the user’s plan limits (e.g., Free: "3/5 Items per Template").
- Prevent selection if adding another blueprint would exceed the tier limit, and show an upgrade prompt.

---

## 4. Brand Assets
**UI Elements:**
- A gallery view displaying thumbnails for brand assets (logos, symbols, etc.).
- Folder organization (BrandAssets folders) to group assets.
- An upload interface for adding new assets with metadata.

**UX Considerations:**
- No specific tier restrictions; however, consider providing more storage for premium tiers if necessary.

## 5. Designs
**UI Elements:**
- A portfolio grid showing design thumbnails, titles, and brief metadata.
- An upload interface with both single and bulk upload options.
- Inline editing for design details.
- Assignment controls to link designs to templates.

**UX Considerations:**
- Enforce daily upload limits based on tier:
  - Free: **10 designs/day**; if exceeded, prompt the user to upgrade for unlimited uploading.
  - Creator/Pro/Enterprise: Unlimited uploads.

---

## 6. Collections
**UI Elements:**
- A folder hierarchy interface (Collection Manager) to organize templates and designs.
- Drag-and-drop functionality for arranging items within collections.
- Options for bulk operations like scheduling or applying discount codes.

**UX Considerations:**
- Allow premium users to manage collections with no limits, while Free users might have limited collection features.
- Provide clear visual feedback for bulk operations and scheduled tasks.

---

## 7. Upload
**UI Elements:**
- A dedicated upload page with a drag-and-drop area and file input for design files.
- Fields for entering design metadata and selecting templates.
- A progress bar and real-time upload status.

**UX Considerations:**
- Validate upload limits (e.g., 10 designs/day for Free users) and show error messages or upgrade prompts if exceeded.

---

## 8. Sync
**UI Elements:**
- A sync management page displaying current sync status, logs, and manual sync triggers.
- A clear status dashboard with icons and color indicators (e.g., success, pending, error).

**UX Considerations:**
- Allow users to manually trigger syncs.
- Display error logs and retry options.
- Tier-based restrictions may apply (e.g., Free users might have limited sync frequency).

---

## 9. Drops
**UI Elements:**
- A drops management page with a calendar and countdown timers for scheduled limited edition drops.
- A drop editor to create new drops by selecting collections or individual templates.
- Visual feedback for upcoming and active drops.

**UX Considerations:**
- Enterprise-level users can access advanced scheduling and bulk drop options.
- Provide notifications and alerts for upcoming drops.

---

## 10. Auto Sync
**UI Elements:**
- A configuration panel for auto sync settings (toggle switches, interval inputs).
- Real-time status monitors showing active auto sync operations.

**UX Considerations:**
- Auto sync settings should be configurable based on tier: shorter intervals for premium users.
- Visual confirmation that auto sync is active and functioning correctly.

---

## 11. Seasonal Sync
**UI Elements:**
- A scheduling page for seasonal sync campaigns with date pickers and timeline views.
- A batch sync trigger to force a seasonal sync manually if required.

**UX Considerations:**
- Offer granular control for premium users, allowing fine-tuned seasonal syncs for entire product lineups.
- Provide error handling and detailed logs.

---

## 12. Analytics
**UI Elements:**
- A dashboard featuring charts, graphs, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Filtering options to view metrics by time period, product category, or sales channel.
- Detailed reports and export options.

**UX Considerations:**
- Ensure data is presented in a clear, digestible format.
- Provide interactive elements for drilling down into specific metrics.
- Tier-based features might include more detailed analytics for premium users.

---

## 13. Notifications
**UI Elements:**
- A notifications center displaying recent alerts, system messages, and sync statuses.
- List items with icons, timestamps, and action buttons (e.g., "View Details", "Dismiss").
- Settings to configure notification preferences (email, in-app, SMS).

**UX Considerations:**
- Real-time notifications must be clear but non-disruptive.
- Provide options to filter or search notifications.

---

## 14. Settings
**UI Elements:**
- A centralized settings page divided into sections:
  - **Account Settings:** Profile information, password management.
  - **API & Supplier Integration:** Fields for managing API keys, supplier credentials.
  - **Shop & Store Configurations:** Settings for connected sales channels.
  - **Subscription & Tier Management:** View current plan, usage limits, and upgrade options.
  - **Customization:** Theme (light/dark mode), dashboard layout.
  
**UX Considerations:**
- Use tabbed or accordion layouts for clear organization.
- Inline validation and clear messaging for updating settings.
- Provide contextual help or tooltips for advanced configuration options.

---

## Final Considerations

- **Membership Enforcement:**  
  Each page must integrate logic (both frontend and backend) to enforce membership limits. For instance, if a Free user attempts to exceed template or design upload limits, prompt an upgrade modal with clear messaging.

- **Modular Components:**  
  Build each UI component as a self-contained module, ensuring ease of maintenance and future enhancements.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The entire UI should be fully responsive, with special attention to mobile and tablet views.

- **Integration Testing:**  
  Ensure all API endpoints and UI components are integrated properly, and that tier-based restrictions are enforced across all user interactions.

This detailed, multifaceted guide should serve as a blueprint for developing the UI and UX of PrintVision.Cloud, ensuring a modern, user-friendly interface that respects membership tier limits and streamlines product management operations.
