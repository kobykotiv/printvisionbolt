While monolithic architectures are often perceived as rigid and inflexible, modern approaches allow us to introduce dynamic capabilities without sacrificing the benefits of a self-hosted monolithic setup.

## Understanding Dynamic Capabilities

In the context of monolithic applications, dynamicness refers to the ability to:
- Adapt to changing workloads
- Modify behavior without redeployment
- Handle variable configurations
- Respond to runtime conditions
